    "## Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM Networks are more developed versions of simple Recurrent Neural Networks. Normally when we want to backpropagate an error in a nerual net (i.e. flow through the layers of the model and use the error function you defined to make the layers better), we have a Gradient Problem. The Gradient Problem occurs when the backpropagation has a gradient for the error. Meaning that (usually) the eariler layers will not recive that 'learning'.\n",
    "\n",
    "![images/gradient_problem.jpeg](images/gradient_problem.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This then causes 'short-term-memory' and impairs the ability to create longer sequences as outputs. LSTM's are a response to this problem. Thus they are used in many sequence applications such as speach recognition, translation etc. LSTM's models keep relevent information in order to make predictions. Information is passed along through the sequencer through this idea of 'hidden states'. The following image shows the hidden state being passed along, 'Tanh Function' ensures that the values says between $-1$ and $1$. \n",

    "But thanks to the **open-source community** we can use the TensorFlow library to build our own, simpler LSTM model. \n",

    "## Set Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Initally when I ran the `fit` function it was estimating that it would take about 3 hours per Epoch which would have taken an incredibly long amount of time. To expedite this I repurposed my gaming desktop to become my machine learning compiler. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Note:_ The 3 hours was taken with a batch size of 124 on the original unmodified model, but this number changed significantly once I changed the model. The sentiment still carries though, utilizing the GPU drastically reduced the runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "I installed Ubuntu on a new partition and installed the NVidia Cuda. Cuda piece of software created by NVidia to enable developers to use NVidia graphics cards for general purpose processing (instead of being restricted to video processing). After that I installed `openssh` so I could ssh remotly into my computer and finally `TensorFlow` along with the other needed pip packages to run my code. \n",
    "\n",
    "After 3 re-installs of Ubuntu I was finally able to get everything working. After utilizing my desktops graphics card I was able to reduce the processing time for one Epoch to 30 minutes, so about a $83.33\\%$ decrese in processing time.\n",

    "Setting up Ubuntu and my desktop actaully turned out to be one of my biggest challenges. I understood that my results would eventually be determined by the content of my model, but being able to develop in a time effient manor was something I also valued. Following what a list of some of the things I was able to accomplish on my desktop PC during my limited time:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Ubuntu`\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Installing Ubuntu seemed like an easy enough task, but it took some time to understand boot loaders and boot devices. In a previous job I had worked with Fedora so I decided to use that as my Linux distribution, but I quickly realized that there was limited (if any) documentation on how to set up my Nvidia drivers on Fedora. So I had to switch to Ubuntu in order to have access to that documentation. This lead to another mistake; not formatting the partition before re-installing Linux. This lead to some limited memory issues and I quickly realized (after I had set up my Nvidia drivers) that I would have to re-format the drive again and re-install Ubuntu. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* `Cuda` & `Cudnn`\n",
    "\n",
    "    * My knowledge of Cuda lead me to believe that it was the only thing needed to utilize my graphics card for machine learning. But in reality there was actually another library called [Cudnn](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) that was actually doing a lot of the heavy machine learning lifting. What was particularly challenging about this library was there was actually no installer (that I could find) that would do the installation for you. This resulted in me figuring out where the `Cuda` library files were stored, and manually copying in the relevent `Cudnn` files. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* `Jupyter Notebook` & `OpenSSH`\n",
    "\n",
    "    * These two were definitly _optional_ but things that I wanted :). Initializing a Jupyter Notebook that would be accessable through anyone in the local network to connect to was something on my TODO list. Learning about how local IP address differ from external (exposed) IP address was another thing I was able to learn about. It was not enought to start the notebook on `127.0.0.1` (AKA `localhost`), instead I needed to start the notebook on my computers external local IP address (AKA `10.0.1.40`). `OpenSSH` was a little easier to get started with as most of that configuration was done through the package installation.\n",
